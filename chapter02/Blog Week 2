## Blog Week 2

June 26,2015

This week I have learned a lot! We began learning about Java and a lot of the stuff we learned in chapter one is related to math. This made it very easy to learn because I think that Math is my best subject and I LOVE algebra! It was kind of challenging because we had to solve it by order of operations and there were some in which I didn't know which part I had to do first. We also began doing our mood boards which I found lots of fun! I created my board on pinterest which I already had experience doing. The pictures that I selected to have in my board involved fashion, music, nature, quotes and my family! overall this week went well, but We just started working on chapter 2 of our workbook and i'm struggling a bit with it .
